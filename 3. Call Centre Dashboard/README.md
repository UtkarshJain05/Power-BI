# 📞 Call Centre Dashboard (Power BI)

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains a Power BI Template (`.pbit`) designed to help analyze call centre operations. With a strong data model and clear dashboard design, it offers actionable insights into call volumes, agent performance, and operational metrics.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Understanding performance within a call centre can be complex — multiple teams, varied call outcomes, fluctuating response times, and high customer expectations.

This project aims to address questions such as:
- How many calls are being handled daily?
- Which agents are underperforming or over-performing?
- What are the resolution rates and wait times?
- Which call types are most common or problematic?

## 🏠 Dashboard - Homepage

The home page of the dashboard gives a bird's-eye view of total calls, resolution rates, average handling time, and high-level KPIs. Filters by team and agent allow you to drill down into the data.

## 🧾 Dashboard - Call Grid Page

This page provides a detailed grid layout of all call records — ideal for operational review, quality checks, or auditing. You can search by call ID, agent, or outcome, and apply slicers for specific time periods or segments.
